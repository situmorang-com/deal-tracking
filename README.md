# deal-tracking
A deal tracking app is a focused part of a CRM that helps sales teams move opportunities from first contact to closed‑won. It combines clear sales pipeline management with a visual pipeline where each stage reflects a step in your sales process, giving instant clarity on what’s active, stuck, or ready to close.
